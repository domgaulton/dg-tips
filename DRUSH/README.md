```
if you do `drush sa` in your local, youâ€™ll see all the aliases available for the project

examples might be: `dev`, `test` and `prod`
which is more like: `dev`, `stg` and `prod`

@self is the environment where you are right now. 
To check this check `drush status` would be the same as doing drush @self status
